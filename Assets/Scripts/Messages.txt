Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.

With new day comes new strength and new thoughts

We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.

To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.
